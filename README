NAMD Steered Molecular Dynamics

quick description:
 -steered molecular dynamics with NAMD
 -obtaining the PMF stretching a peptide

Preparations:
 1) place 00.pdb and 00.psf for any peptide, previously subjected to
    equilibration, in its own directory in 08.struc-equil folder
    >>> for a peptide, pep, /08.struc-equil/pep/00.pdb,00.psf 
 2) create solvent templates in 0000-maindir for a new peptide
    >>> /0000-maindir/pep/maindir-[v,i,e]/smd.namd
 3) make necessary modifications to setup.py
 4) './setup.py' creates the working directories
 5) upload the directory onto a cluster 
 6) './run.py' submits all job.sh scripts to the PBS resource manager
